The light is nothing
Listen to the heart
Listen to the mind
Listen to the body
Listen to the depths
Until the depths is gone
Burn the heart into the soul
Cast the depths into the darkness
If the soul is smaller than the darkness
Build the light up

Let the heart be the mind
Let the mind be the body
Let the body be the depths
Listen to the depths

Shout the light
